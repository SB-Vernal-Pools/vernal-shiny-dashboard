##### Tips:

1. There are two pool-level visualizations for weekly water level and relative plant species abundance
2. One of seven possible transect-level visualizations can be viewed using the **Select Metric** drop down menu
3. When **Percent Cover Single Species** is the selected metric, an additional drop-down menu will appear, listing the native and non-native plant species within the vernal pool
