The data in this dashboard was collected by Cheadle Center staff, Joanna Tang, and associated interns.  Briana Barajas, Rosemary Juarez, and Vanessa Salgado Zavaleta transformed the data into this dashboard by using RStudio’s ShinyApp interface.  Joanna completed her PhD at UCSB in 2024 and collaborated with Cheadle Center staff and interns to monitor vernal pools in Isla Vista, on UCSB’s campus, and in Santa Barbara.  Joanna’s PhD research investigated long-term monitoring, management, and restoration of these vernal pools.  She had so much fun exploring these amazing ecosystems, and she hopes that this data dashboard can help other community members and scientists learn more about vernal pools.
