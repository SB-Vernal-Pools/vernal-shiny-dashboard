Vernal pool polygons were recorded on a Trimble in winter 2019 by walking around the perimeter of the pool.

Vernal pool vegetation is recorded annually in the spring.  For each pool, we laid out two transects bisecting the pool along its elliptical major and minor axes.  Every other meter along each transect, we laid down a 1m2 quadrat with 1% subdivisions.  We identified every plant species present and estimated its percent cover in each quadrat.  We also estimated the percent cover of bare ground and thatch.  Because low-growing graminoids and forbs were overlaid with taller species, the total percent cover could exceed 100% in each quadrat.

Vernal pool hydrology is recorded weekly during the wet phase.  To measure hydrology, we installed 0.8m rulers in the deepest part of each pool and recorded the depth of the water in each pool every week.
