#### **This page covers two dashboards:**

 -  **Vernal Map dashboard**
 -  **Data Visualizer dashboard**

Our map dashboard provides key information about each vernal pool, including:

-  Pool Depth (cm)
-  Pool Area (m²)
-  Pool Circumference (ft)
-  Site Area (m²)
-  Month and Year of data collection

This information can be accessed by clicking on a pool polygon

 **Plot Types:**

Users can generate various types of plots:
1.  Water Level: Shows changes in water level over time.
2.  Species Abundance: Displays the abundance of different species.
3.  Native Cover: Shows the coverage of native plant species.
4.  Non-Native Cover: Shows the coverage of non-native plant species.
5.  Species Cover: Displays coverage for a specific selected species.


**Data Sources:**

The visualizations draw from two main data sources:
a. Hydro data: Contains information about water levels.
b. Percent cover data: Contains information about plant species coverage.


**Data Collection**
Vernal pool polygons were recorded on a Trimble in winter 2019 by walking around the perimeter of the pool.

Vernal pool vegetation is recorded annually in the spring.  For each pool, we laid out two transects bisecting the pool along its elliptical major and minor axes.  Every other meter along each transect, we laid down a 1m2 quadrat with 1% subdivisions.  We identified every plant species present and estimated its percent cover in each quadrat.  We also estimated the percent cover of bare ground and thatch.  Because low-growing graminoids and forbs were overlaid with taller species, the total percent cover could exceed 100% in each quadrat.

Vernal pool hydrology is recorded weekly during the wet phase.  To measure hydrology, we installed 0.8m rulers in the deepest part of each pool and recorded the depth of the water in each pool every week.
